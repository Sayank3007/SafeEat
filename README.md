# SafeEat
SafeEat is a platform which combines food quality indexing using hardware with decentralization and process tracking.
SafeEat uses the following:-
Blockchain for food supply chain
 Arduino for food quality testing
 Machine learning for food quality prediction based on results of the hardware
SafeEat accomplishes the following:-
Food supply chain that’s un-hackable and un-corruptable
 Health standards that learn
 Food and soil indexing that’s visualizable
 Multilingual support
 How it works:-
Users login with Aadhar card
Farmer tests his soil (if tier 5 or 6 farmer then no need for soil testing hardware) , genesis block created in the blockchain if quality is good
Farmer goes to the Local market (vendor)
Vendor scans farmer's aadhar card
Vendor connects to the quality testing hardware to his phone using bluetooth
Ownership is transferred and block is updated if quality is good
From vendor to whole seller, from whole seller to the supermarkets, repeat steps 4 to 6
User gets quality tested goods and can visualize the quality during each exchange
Future Scope of SafeEat:-
Detect diseases in plants
Distribution of left over food
Geotagging batch productions
Useful statistics for study of GM crops
Seed storage share
Loan eligibility based on quality produced
